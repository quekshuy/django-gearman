django-gearman
==============

*django-gearman* is a convenience wrapper for the [Gearman][Gearman]
[Python Bindings][python-gearman].

With django-gearman, you can code jobs as well as clients in a Django project
with minimal overhead in your application. Server connections etc. all take
place in django-gearman and don't unnecessarily clog your application code.

Installation
------------
It's the same for both the client and worker instances of your django project:

    pip install -e git://github.com/fwenzel/django-gearman.git#egg=django-gearman

Add ``django_gearman`` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` section of `settings.py`.

Specify the following setting in your local settings.py file:

    # One or more gearman servers
    GEARMAN_SERVERS = ['127.0.0.1']

Workers
-------
### Registering jobs
Create a file `gearman_jobs.py` in any of your django apps, and define as many
jobs as functions as you like. The jobs must accept a single argument as
passed by the caller and must return the result of the operation, if
applicable. (Note: It must accept an argument, even if you don't use it).

Mark each of these functions as gearman jobs by decorating them with
`django_gearman.decorators.gearman_job`.

For an example, look at the `gearman_example` app's `gearman_jobs.py` file.

### Job naming
The tasks are given a default name of their import path, with the phrase
'gearman_jobs' stripped out of them, for readability reasons. You can override
the task name by specifying `name` parameter of the decorator. Here's how:

    @gearman_job(name='my-task-name')
    def my_task_function(foo):
        pass
        
### Task parameters
The gearman docs specify that the job function can accept only one parameter
(usually refered to as the ``data`` parameter). Additionally, that parameter
may only be a string. Sometimes that may not be enough. What if you would like
to pass an array or a dict? You would need to serialize and deserialize them.
Fortunately, django-gearman can take care of this, so that you can spend
all of your time on coding the actual task.

    @gearman_job(name='my-task-name')
    def my_task_function(foo):
        pass
    
    client.submit_job('my-task-name', {'foo': 'becomes', 'this': 'dict'})
    client.submit_job('my-task-name', Decimal(1.0))

### Tasks with more than one parameter

You can pass as many arguments as you want, of whatever (serializable) type
you like. Here's an example job definition:

    @gearman_job(name='my-task-name')
    def my_task_function(one, two, three):
        pass
        
You can execute this function in two different ways:

    client.submit_job('my-task-name', one=1, two=2, three=3)
    client.submit_job('my-task-name', args=[1, 2, 3])
    
Unfortunately, executing it like this:
    
    client.submit_job('my-task-name', 1, 2, 3)
    
would produce the error, because ``submit_job`` from Gearman's Python bindings
contains __a lot__ of arguments and it's much easier to specify them via
keyword names or a special ``args`` keyword than to type something like seven
``None``s instead:

    client.submit_job('my-task-name', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 1, 2, 3)

The only limitation that you have are gearman reserved keyword parameters. As of
Gearman 2.0.2 these are:

    * data
    * unique
    * priority
    * background
    * wait_until_complete
    * max_retries
    * poll_timeout
    
So, if you want your job definition to have, for example, ``unique`` or
``background`` keyword parameters, you need to execute the job in a special,
more verbose way. Here's an example of such a job and its execution.

    @gearman_job(name='my-task-name')
    def my_task_function(background, unique):
        pass
        
    client.submit_job('my-task-name', kwargs={"background": True, "unique": False})
    client.submit_job('my-task-name', args=[True, False])
    
Finally:

    client.submit_job('my-task-name', background=True, unique=True, kwargs={"background": False, "unique": False})
    
Don't panic, your task is safe! That's because you're using ``kwargs``
directly. Therefore, Gearman's bindings would receive ``True`` for
``submit_job`` function, while your task would receive ``False``.

Always remember to double-check your parameter names with the reserved words
list.

### Starting a worker
To start a worker, run `python manage.py gearman_worker`. It will start
serving all registered jobs.

To spawn more than one worker (if, e.g., most of your jobs are I/O bound),
use the `-w` option:

    python manage.py gearman_worker -w 5

will start five workers.

Since the process will keep running while waiting for and executing jobs,
you probably want to run this in a _screen_ session or similar.

### Task queues
Queues are a virtual abstraction layer built on top of gearman tasks. An
easy way to describe it is the following example: Imagine you have a task
for fetching e-mails from the server, another task for sending the emails
and one more task for sending SMS via an SMS gateway. A problem you may
encounter is that the email fetching tasks may effectively "block" the worker
(there could be so many of them, it could be so time-consuming, that no other
task would be able to pass through). Of course, one solution would be to add
more workers (via the ``-w`` parameter), but that would only temporarily
solve the problem. This is where queues come in.

The first thing to do is to pass a queue name into the job description, like
this:

    @gearman_job(queue="my-queue-name")
    def some_job(some_arg):
        pass
    
You may then proceed to starting the worker that is bound to the specific
queue:

    python manage.py gearman_worker -w 5 -q my-queue-name
    
Be aware of the fact that when you don't specify the queue name, the worker
will take care of all tasks.

Background Tasks
-------
The notation for the task name is `appname.jobname`, no matter what pattern
you have defined in `GEARMAN_JOB_NAME`.

Dispatching a background event without waiting for the result is easy as well:

    client.dispatch_background_task('gearman_example.background_counting', None)

For a live example look at the `gearman_example` app, in the
`management/commands/gearman_example_client.py` file.

Example App
-----------
For a full, working, example application, add `gearman_example` to your
`INSTALLED_APPS`, then run a worker in one shell:

    python manage.py gearman_worker -w 4

and execute the example app in another:

    python manage.py gearman_example_client

You can see the client sending data and the worker(s) working on it.
